Itâ€™s possible to statically map all the MAC addresses in a network to their rightful IP addresses. This is highly effective in preventing ARP Poisoning attacks but adds a tremendous administrative burden. Any change to the network will require manual updates of the ARP tables across all hosts, making static ARP tables unfeasible for most larger organizations. Still, in situations where security is crucial, carving out a separate network segment where static ARP tables are used can help to protect critical information.
