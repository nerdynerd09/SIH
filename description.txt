ARP cache poisoning is the act of introducing a specious IP-to-Ethernet address mapping in another hostâ€™s ARP cache. This results in diversion of traffic, either to a different host on the LAN or no host at all. ARP spoofing, also known as the "Man In The Middle" attack, can thus be used to compromise the subnet. Even though ARP spoofing is possible only on a LAN it is still a security breach.
