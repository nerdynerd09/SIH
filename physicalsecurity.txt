Properly controlling physical access to your place of business can help mitigate ARP Poisoning attacks. ARP messages are not routed beyond the boundaries of the local network, so would-be attackers must be in physical proximity to the victim network or already have control of a machine on the network. Note that in the case of wireless networks, proximity doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the attacker needs direct physical access; a signal extends to a street or parking lot may be sufficient. Whether wired or wireless, the use of technology like 802.1x can ensure that only trusted and/or managed devices can connect to the network.
